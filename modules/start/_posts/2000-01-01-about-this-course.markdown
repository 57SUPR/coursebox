The course is split in 4 modules for 4 different aspects of online courses: **community**, **learning on the web**, **content** and **feedback and assessment**.

Every module has an outcome or two directly related to building your course. Every module also have projects, reading and other resources to help you.

Once a week we have a community hangout where we discuss the work we are busy with. You can wait for us to organize one or go ahead and organize your own course.

Throughout the course you are encourage to use the discourse forum to share your work, get feedback, ask for support and any other discussion really.

# How do I sign up and take this course?

You may not have noticed, but you are already taking this course, you're busy with the start module. There are three main things to do in this module:

1. Sign up for a cohort (should you choose to do so).
2. Introduce yourself on the forums.
3. Start building your course. This step is not optional :)

Normally this is where we tell you to fill in a form and wait for us, but we're not going to do that. You can 'sign up' to this course by [**taking your course out of the box** here]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/start/the-box/) and start learning.
