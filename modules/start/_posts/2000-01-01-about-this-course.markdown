The course is split in 4 modules: **community**, **learning on the web**, **content** and **feedback and assessment**.

Each module has outcomes directly related to building your course. Every module also have projects, reading and other resources to help you.

Once a week we have a community hangout where we discuss the work we are busy with. You can wait for us to organize one or go ahead and organize your own course.

## Join a cohort or work at your own pace

You can choose to do this course as part of a cohort or you can do the course at your own pace.

If you join the cohort, we will all kick off at the same time and work through the modules week by week. We'll send out emails to everyone in the cohort each week and there will be more activity in the course while the cohort is going.

If you choose to do the course on your own pace, that is no problem. The emails that are sent to the cohort is mostly about scheduling.

## The course forum (community.p2pu.org)

Whether you are going at your own pace or doing it with a cohort, [community.p2pu.org](http://community.p2pu.org) is the center of the community for this course. Here you can ask any question, share your work or other interesting readings and meet people who are also building online courses to collaborate with.

**Doing the course at your own pace does not mean that you have to do the course on your own.**

## Where do I go from here?

1. [Join a cohort]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/start/join-a-cohort/) (should you choose to do so).
2. [Introduce yourself]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/start/introduce-yourself/) on the forums.
3. [Start building your course]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/start/create-your-course/). This step is not optional :)
