# Discussion on community.p2pu.org

Join discussion about community on [discourse](http://community.p2pu.org/c/course-in-a-box/community).

{% include category_gallery.html forum_url='http://community.p2pu.org' category='course-in-a-box/community' %}

## Hangout

TODO - Embed calendar here.

Have a look at the calender on the front page to see when the hangout about community is happening.

But don't let that stop you if the next scheduled hangout is to far out. You can organize your very own hangout! Look at [this script](http://todo.com) for some ideas on how to structure your hangout. Post the date and time that you want to hold the hangout on discourse and you can use [this link](https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/h/course-in-a-box) to hang out.
