## Homepage

The homepage is the part of your course that most people will see first. By default, it shows a "jumbotron" (large banner with the course title, headline, and icon) and an open space to describe the materials inside the course. This information can be changed at any time without affecting other parts of your course.

#### Customize the Jumbotron

Settings for the background of the Jumbotron banner at the top of the page are made in the `_config.yml` file. If you've uploaded the images into the `img` folder, you can replace the text after `img/` with the file name for the image you want to use. You can also replace the link with an externally-hosted image.

[https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml](https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml)


```
jumbotron_color: "#FFF"
jumbotron_image: "img/jumbotron-image.svg"
jumbotron_mask: "img/jumbotron-mask.svg"
jumbotron_icon: "img/box-icon.png"
```

- `jumbotron_color` is the background color that will be used if nothing else is defined
- `jumbotron_image` is the image that will be use as the background. If it's a repeating pattern, it must be saved as an SVG file. All other files
- `jumbotron_mask` is a dark mask to be applied over the background image to improve legibility
- `jumbotron_icon` is the icon on the jumbotron

#### Set the Course Title + Headline

The name of a course is set by editing the file called `_data/course.yml`. (“`_data/`“ means that the file is nested in the folder called `_data`.)

[https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/blog/gh-pages/_data/course.yml](https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/edit/gh-pages/_data/course.yml)

By default, the information in this file will read: 

```
title: Course-in-a-Box
description: An open-source project for creating online courses, built by <a href="https://www.p2pu.org">P2PU</a>
modules: [tutorial, resources, references]
```

- **Title:** This text appears as the title of the page in your browser. 
- **Description:** This text appears as the headline in the large banner on the course landing page.
- **Modules:** This list controls the modules that appear in the top menu of your course. (See the [Add Modules](/modules/content/modules/) section of this tutorial for more information.)

Commit the changes when you’re finished and refresh your course page after a few minutes to see the edits appear.

#### Update the Course Description

Customize the text about your course on its front page by editing the `index.md` file in the main folder of the course: 

[https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/blob/gh-pages/index.md](https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/blob/gh-pages/index.md)

This is a good place to explain a basic overview of the course material, materials required, or instructions for sign-up. [See Markdown cheatsheet for ways to format this information.]()
