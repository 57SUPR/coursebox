title: Editing the Homepage
---

The homepage is the part of your course that most people will see first. By default, it shows a "jumbotron" (large banner with the course title, headline, and icon) and an open space to describe the materials inside the course. This information can be changed at any time without affecting other parts of your course.

## Set the Course Title + Headline

The name of a course is set by editing the file called `_data/course.yml`. (“`_data/`“ means that the file is nested in the folder called `_data`.)

[https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/blog/gh-pages/_data/course.yml](https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/edit/gh-pages/_data/course.yml)

By default, the information in this file will read: 

```
title: Course-in-a-Box
description: An open-source project for creating online courses, built by <a href="https://www.p2pu.org">P2PU</a>
modules: [tutorial, resources, references]
```

- **Title:** This text appears as the title of the page in your browser. 
- **Description:** This text appears as the headline in the large banner on the course landing page.
- **Modules:** This list controls the modules that appear in the top menu of your course. (See the [Add Modules](/modules/content/modules/) section of this tutorial for more information.)

Commit the changes when you’re finished and refresh your course page after a few minutes to see the edits appear.

## Update the Course Description

Customize the text about your course on its front page by editing the `index.md` file in the main folder of the course: 

[https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/blob/gh-pages/index.md](https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/blob/gh-pages/index.md)

This is a good place to explain a basic overview of the course material, materials required, or instructions for sign-up. [See Markdown cheatsheet for ways to format this information.]()
