## Using Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a free web analytics service that tracks and reports website traffic. If you're interested in seeing information like how people are finding your course, what country they live in, and how long they spend on different pages, you'll like Google Analytics!

1. Head to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com/) and sign in with or create a Google account
1. Create a new property ([more info](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1042508)) for your CIAB website (You'll need to enter the URL it lives at, so if you want to set up a custom domain, this is best done last)
1. Copy the Tracking ID information (should look like "UA-000000000-0")
1. Add your tracking code after the `ga_tracking_code:` line of `_config.yml`
