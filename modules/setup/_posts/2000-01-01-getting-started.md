## Getting Started with GitHub

Course-in-a-Box courses are used as websites and are edited and hosted through GitHub, a web-based service for managing code and collaborating with a global community on projects. If you don’t have one, you’ll need to create a GitHub account. (Free for personal use!)

If you’re new to GitHub, it can be a complex system to get used to. For a great basic primer on GitHub, check out [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and the [GitHub Term Glossary](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary). If you get stuck at any point in the setup process, head to our community forum and someone can help you out!

To make things easier, we can automatically generate all of the links in this guide for you if you provide your GitHub username in the box below. If this tool doesn't work, you can also copy the links into your browser and replace 'your-github-username' with your real username.

<!--<div id="ghUsername-intro">
If you tell us your username, we can prepare some links and make things a bit easier for you. If for some reason it doesn't work, replace 'your-github-username' with your GitHub username where you see links containing 'your-github-username'
</div>-->

Please note that everything in this guide is based on editing a course directly in GitHub where updates can take a few minutes to appear live on your site. If you’d prefer to work locally, you can run Jekyll on your computer to speed up information.
