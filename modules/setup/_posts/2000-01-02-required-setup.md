## Required Setup

Once you’re logged in to GitHub, the first step of creating a course is to copy ( “fork”) the Course-in-a-Box project folder ( “repository”) from P2PU’s account to yours. This will make an identical copy of this website and its content in your account library. (Making your course is essentially editing out our content and customizing it with your own.)

Head to [P2PU’s course-in-a-box project](https://github.com/p2pu/course-in-a-box) and click “Fork” in the top right or click the button below to start this process:

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://github.com/p2pu/course-in-a-box/fork" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-code-fork"></i> Fork this repository on GitHub.</a> 

<br>

#### Delete CNAME
Once you’ve forked the project, you’ll need to remove the **CNAME** file that appears in the main list of folders and files. (This file is specific to P2PU’s web hosting for this tutorial website, and it’ll prevent your site from working if you keep it.) Click the file to open it:

[https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/blob/gh-pages/CNAME](https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/blob/gh-pages/CNAME)

<br> 

#### Your course is now live!

You can view it by going to 

[https://your-github-username.github.io/course-in-a-box/](https://your-github-username.github.io/course-in-a-box/)

(It may take a few minutes to show up!)
